# From Data to Decisions

> Why genetic evaluation data leads to better sheep breeding decisions, and how the numbers connect to the real-world choices a producer makes about sires, matings, and long-term flock improvement.

## The Shape of a Breeding Decision

Every breeding decision is an attempt to predict the future: which animals, mated in which combinations, will produce the most profitable and resilient flock several generations from now. Genetic evaluation data does not make that decision for you, but it narrows the uncertainty. It turns a question that was once answered by eye and intuition ("this looks like a good ram") into one answered by evidence ("this ram's progeny are predicted to wean three pounds heavier without raising birth weight").

The decisions themselves form a natural progression. First a producer settles on a breeding objective. Then candidates are identified, evaluated individually, and compared against each other. Pedigree relationships are examined to avoid concentrating risk. Matings are allocated. Finally, progress is monitored across lamb crops so that the next round of decisions is better informed than the last. NSIP data — accessed through the `nsip` CLI, library, and MCP tools — supplies evidence at each of these stages. The practical mechanics of each step live in the [how-to guides](../how-to/COMPARE-ANIMALS.md); this document is about *why* the data matters and how to reason with it.

## Starting From an Objective, Not From the Data

It is tempting to open a search, sort by the highest weaning-weight EBV, and call the top animal the winner. This inverts the logic. The data only becomes meaningful once you know what you are selecting for, and that depends on your production system, your market, and your constraints.

A flock selling market lambs values growth and carcass merit. A self-replacing flock must also value the maternal traits its retained daughters will need. A producer in a parasite-challenged environment weights resistance traits that another producer can safely ignore. The same animal can be an excellent choice for one objective and a poor one for another. The objective decides which EBVs to prioritize and which selection index, if any, captures your goals — a subject explored in [Breed Groups and Traits](BREED-GROUPS-AND-TRAITS.md).

## Reading an Individual Animal

An EBV is only interpretable against a backdrop. A weaning-weight EBV of +3.0 means three pounds above the current breed average — but "above average" tells you little until you know how wide the breed's range is. A trait that varies from -1 to +12 across the breed makes +3.0 unremarkable; a trait that tops out at +4.0 makes it exceptional. Breed-level trait ranges supply that backdrop, and the [how-to guide on filtering and ranges](../how-to/FILTER-SEARCH-RESULTS.md) shows how to retrieve them.

Two qualifications matter as much as the EBV itself. The first is **accuracy**: a high EBV backed by little data is a promise, not a fact, and may move substantially as progeny records accumulate. [Understanding EBVs](EBV-EXPLAINED.md) discusses how to weigh accuracy against headline value. The second is **trait balance**: an animal outstanding in one trait may carry a hidden liability in another. A ram with the flock's best weaning weight but a very high birth weight may simply trade growth gains for lambing difficulty. Reading the full trait profile, rather than a single number, is what separates a durable choice from a regretted one.

## Why Comparison Reveals What Single Animals Hide

Looking at one animal answers "is this good?" Comparing several answers the more useful question: "which of these is best for me, and what do I give up by choosing it?" Side-by-side comparison surfaces the trade-offs — one candidate leads on growth, another on maternal traits, a third balances both at slightly lower peaks. The [how-to guide on comparing animals](../how-to/COMPARE-ANIMALS.md) walks through the mechanics.

Crucially, EBVs are not the whole decision. Structural soundness, temperament, price, logistics, and the genetic diversity an animal brings to the flock are all real factors the numbers cannot see. Genetic evaluation tells you which animals are genetically superior; it does not tell you which one has sound feet or fits your budget. The data informs the decision; it does not replace the judgment around it.

## Pedigree, Inbreeding, and the Cost of Concentration

Before any mating is finalized, the pedigree deserves scrutiny — not for its own sake, but because mating related animals concentrates genes, and concentration cuts both ways. The desirable alleles an animal carries become more likely to pair up in its offspring, but so do the recessive deleterious ones that every population carries silently. This is **inbreeding depression**, and in sheep it shows up as reduced lamb survival, lower fertility, weaker immune function, and slower growth — precisely the traits a breeding program is trying to improve.

The Coefficient of Inbreeding (COI) quantifies this risk for a proposed mating using Wright's path formula over the shared pedigree. A producer can examine lineage and compute COI before committing, rather than discovering the problem in a disappointing lamb crop. The reason to look is not abstract genetic hygiene; it is that the short-term temptation to "mate the best to the best" repeatedly through one outstanding sire line is exactly how a flock accumulates inbreeding it will later pay for. Maintaining genetic diversity — spreading matings across unrelated superior animals — preserves the variation that future selection depends on. The [mating-recommendations how-to](../how-to/MATING-RECOMMENDATIONS.md) shows how to fold inbreeding checks into mate selection in practice.

## Mating Allocation as Synthesis

Deciding which ram covers which ewes is where every prior piece of analysis converges. Four objectives pull on the decision at once: maximizing genetic progress by giving superior sires the widest influence, correcting specific weaknesses through complementary pairings, managing inbreeding, and preserving diversity by not over-using any single animal.

The corrective-mating idea rests on a simple genetic fact. Because each parent contributes half its genes, the expected breeding value of offspring is approximately the midpoint of the two parents' EBVs. A ewe with an undesirably high birth-weight EBV, mated to a ram with a low one, produces offspring expected to land between them — pulled back toward the desired range. This is an *expectation*, not a guarantee: actual offspring scatter around the midparent value because of Mendelian sampling, the random half of each parent's genes that any given lamb inherits. The midparent prediction is the reason mating *plans* outperform mating *by reputation*, and it is the principle the [mating-recommendations tool](../how-to/MATING-RECOMMENDATIONS.md) automates.

## Why Progress Must Be Measured Against a Moving Target

Genetic improvement is slow and cumulative, and it is easy to fool yourself about whether it is happening. The honest measure is the genetic trend: are successive lamb crops genetically better than their predecessors for the traits you selected on? Comparing average EBVs across birth years answers this, and monitoring a working sire's progeny tells you whether his early promise is bearing out.

One subtlety makes this harder than it looks. EBVs are expressed relative to a breed base that shifts as the whole breed improves. An animal that was well above average a decade ago may sit below today's average without its genetics having changed at all — the rest of the breed moved. This is also why every comparison must come from the same evaluation run, and why checking the database's last-updated date is not a formality but a guard against comparing numbers that live on different scales.

## A Worked Line of Reasoning

Consider a commercial hair-sheep flock — Katahdin, which as of the most recent evaluation cycle is among the most heavily represented breeds in the NSIP system, giving it a large candidate pool and generally higher-accuracy EBVs. Suppose the objective is to raise weaning weight while holding birth weight in check.

The reasoning proceeds by elimination and balance rather than by chasing a single maximum. Proven rams (high accuracy) are preferred so the choice rests on evidence rather than promise. Candidates are screened for above-average weaning weight while excluding those whose birth-weight EBVs would worsen lambing ease. Among the survivors, the producer weighs maternal traits — because retained daughters will need them — and, in a parasite-prone environment, resistance traits as well. For hair sheep this balancing act is partly pre-packaged: the USA MAT-HAIR index combines the relevant maternal and growth components into a single ranking, with number-of-lambs-weaned carrying the heaviest weight. The index is a convenience, not a substitute for checking the underlying traits and accuracies behind it.

A finalist is not simply the highest-ranked animal but the one whose full profile best fits the objective at acceptable accuracy, whose pedigree does not duplicate existing flock sires, and whose use can be spread to preserve diversity. After the next lamb crop is evaluated, its average EBVs are compared against the previous year's: a sound choice shows weaning weight rising without birth weight following it upward. Because NSIP processes new submissions on a regular cycle, those updated evaluations arrive steadily, and the loop repeats — each decision a little better informed than the last.

## Common Decision Pitfalls

**Chasing the highest number.** The animal that tops one trait is rarely the best overall choice. A breeding decision is a portfolio, not a single bet; the full trait profile and its accuracy matter more than any one peak.

**Ignoring accuracy.** A young ram with a spectacular EBV at low accuracy is a riskier proposition than a proven ram with a good EBV at high accuracy. Confidence in the estimate is part of the estimate's value.

**Forgetting inbreeding.** Mating the best to the best, generation after generation, delivers short-term gains and long-term inbreeding depression. Diversity is a cost paid now to avoid a larger cost later.

**Neglecting maternal traits.** Selecting a terminal sire is comparatively simple. A self-replacing flock must select for the maternal performance its daughters will rely on, not only for growth — which is exactly why composite maternal indexes exist.

**Using outdated data.** EBVs change with each evaluation run. Decisions made against a stale evaluation are decisions made against numbers that no longer describe the animals.
